      <h2 class="post-title">Cybersecurity Basics Everyone Should Know</h2>
      <p class="post-meta">Posted on August 21, 2025 by Aaryan Pokhrel</p>
      <p>Cybersecurity is all about protecting your personal information, devices, and online identity from digital threats. With increasing online activity, it's more important than ever to understand a few essential safety practices.
             Start with strong, unique passwords for every account. Avoid using personal details like birthdays or names. Always enable two-factor authentication when available — it adds an extra layer of protection.
             Be cautious with emails and links, especially from unknown sources. Phishing attacks often look real but are designed to steal your data. Keep your software and antivirus tools up to date to guard against the latest threats.
             Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions, and always log out of shared devices.
             Cybersecurity isn’t just for tech experts — it's a basic skill everyone should practice. Staying informed and alert can save you from serious trouble online.</p>

      <h2 class="post-title">Why aren't you safe using internet</h2>
      <p class="post-meta">Posted on August 21, 2025 by Prashant Pandey</p>
      <p>In today’s digital world, using the internet feels second nature — but most users underestimate just how vulnerable they truly are. From the moment you connect, your data begins traveling across servers, apps, and platforms that might not always be secure.
        Many websites track your behavior, collect your information, and sometimes share it without your knowledge. Public Wi-Fi, although convenient, is a hacker’s playground. Cybercriminals can intercept your connection, steal passwords, or inject malware into your device without you noticing.
          Phishing emails, malicious links, and fake websites are everywhere — and they're more convincing than ever. Even your smart devices at home can be exploited if not properly secured.
          Online privacy is no longer guaranteed. The truth is, every click, download, or sign-in carries a risk. Stay safe by using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and being cautious with what you share online. Awareness is your first line of defense.</p>
